This repository contains the implementation of the methods described in the paper [A Semi-Bayesian Nonparametric Estimator of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy Measure: Applications in Goodness-of-Fit Testing and Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02637). The code provides tools for estimating the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) in a semi-Bayesian nonparametric framework, with applications in goodness-of-fit testing and GANs.

The GAN-related code is based on a Bayesian nonparametric extension of the method from [Li et al. (2015)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/li15.html), with modifications adapted from their publicly available code: [Generative Moment Matching Networks](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/azhw307hgk5v08hy5byix/Generative-Moment-Matching-Networks-master.zip?e=1&rlkey=sclg4jo4noe4m4igwa6a624x7).
